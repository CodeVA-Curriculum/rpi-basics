    This lesson covers the basics of how to use your Raspberry Pi computer. Even though your Pi looks a little bit different than a computer you might be used to (like a laptop, smartphone, or desktop computer), it can do all the things a normal computer can do! You can control your RPi using a mouse and keyboard like you would with other devices, but there are also some special ways to control the computer using a piece of software called the **command line** (which might be new to you). You'll need a couple of things for this lesson:

    * A [Raspberry Pi computer]() set up according to [Lesson 1]({base}/modules/lesson-1)
    * A wireless internet connection

    Once you have all those things, you should be ready to go! In this lesson, you'll learn how to:

    * Navigate your Raspberry Pi device
    * Download and install software using the Raspbian shop
    * Download and install software using the command line
    * Complete basic command line tasks (creating files and folders, editing files, navigating the filesystem)
