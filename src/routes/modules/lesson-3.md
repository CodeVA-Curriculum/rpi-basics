    This lesson covers the basics of how computers communicate with one another over the internet. Your internet at home or at school has a bunch of devices on it, and it's possible to communicate with these devices using your Raspberry Pi. You'll need a couple of things for this lesson:

    * A [Raspberry Pi computer]() set up according to [Lesson 1]({base}/modules/lesson-1)
    * A wireless internet connection (it's okay if the internet access is slow; we don't need to download anything)
    * A second device connected to the wireless internet (other than your RPi)

    Once you have all those things, you should be ready to go! In this lesson, you'll learn how to:

    * Identify your devices' IP address
    * Explore devices connected to a subnetwork
    * Scan a subnet to discover different connected devices
